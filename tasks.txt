Notas sueltas:

 "The spark of twilight revealed, upon worldtrotters approaching us, a new weapon. Thought it's a sword in form, she needed not touch our foes: It was impossibly sharp and made the air smell like a storm once taken out of its scabard and, when a fool in her army looked at the edge directly despite her warnings, he promptly cried in pain and went blindâ€¦
 The spark needed only aproach the enemy batalion, alone, and slash the Zenith across the air swiftly. Her enemies expressed amusement, then concern, then pain as their skin and steel corroded, and they coughed blood.
 Curiously enough she touted the Zenith as her second most powerful weapon, mentioning the first simply 'Wasn't authoritative enough'"
